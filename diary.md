Diary based on each day, CCL1

I began by creating the game loop, an essential part of any game, ensuring that everything runs in sync. The game loop is the heart of the game, controlling updates and rendering each frame. I also worked on defining the main character object, giving it the ability to move and interact with the environment. Adding user input was an exciting part of the day and being able to control the character made everything feel more interactive. Next I moved on to focusing on the game mechanics, laying down the foundation for how the game will function and feel. I worked on implementing collision detection, which involved some trial and error to get it just right. It was a great challenge, and I found satisfaction in fixing issues as they came up.

Throughout the day, I focused on optimizing the game engine to ensure that it runs smoothly. It’s clear that creating a game is a complex process, but today was a great start. I’m looking forward to building on this foundation and seeing where this journey will take me!

The second day of my game development journey has been both productive and exciting! I’ve been busy creating more classes for various objects in the game, expanding the world beyond just the player. I introduced classes for different types of objects, including Food, FakeObjects, and DamagingObjects. Each of these has its own unique behavior, and integrating them into the game logic has been a fun challenge. It’s incredible to see the game world slowly coming together as more interactive elements are added.

I also spent time improving the collision detection, ensuring that these new objects interact properly with the main character and each other. This required a few tweaks and a lot of testing, but it’s definitely paying off as everything feels more realistic.

On the visual side, I added PNGs for each object, bringing more life and detail to the game world. Seeing the objects on screen with their own distinct images makes the game feel much more polished.

In addition to the game mechanics, I focused on creating the Main Page using HTML and CSS. I’m working on the layout and design, making sure the page is intuitive and visually appealing. It’s great to see how all the different aspects of the game are coming together, and I’m excited to continue refining both the gameplay and the user interface.

Today was another productive day in my game development journey. I started by adding sprite sheets to the game, which was an exciting step as it really enhanced the visuals and gave the character and objects a lot more life. The sprite sheets allow for smoother animations, and I can’t wait to implement more complex animations later on.

I spent some time improving the collision detection once again, fine-tuning it to ensure everything behaves as expected. Some of the old collision code wasn’t needed anymore, so I went ahead and removed the unnecessary bits to keep things cleaner and more efficient.

A major milestone today was turning the Character object into a class. This allowed me to better organize the code and give the character more functionality, like easily updating its properties or adding new behaviors. I also worked on creating placeholder animations for the character, although they’re quite simple for now. Even with these basic animations, the game feels a lot more dynamic, and I’m excited to flesh them out further in the coming days.

Performance was also a key focus today. I made several improvements to optimize how the game runs. With the addition of new objects and mechanics, it was important to ensure the game runs smoothly and doesn’t become sluggish. After some tweaks, the game’s performance is definitely improved, and I’m looking forward to continuing to refine it.

Today, I finished working on my actual mechanics of the game and tweaked my hamster's movement settings. Also, I improved my Main Page by adding a few more functionalities. Then, I started drawing my first prototype of the first level's map/environment, which isn't finished yet.

On January 17, 2025, I made significant progress in my game development project. I introduced a new interactive object mechanic, allowing players to push certain objects to advance through levels. This addition enhances the game's interactivity.

I also created new sprites for the hamster character, enriching its visual appeal and providing a more engaging player experience. Additionally, I designed the map for the first level, carefully placing objects to create a balanced and challenging environment.

Finished drawing the background for the second level, added objects to the map and tested everything, making sure there are no glitches or objects that may block the hamster.

21.01

Worked on my main screen, finished designing the main screen page, adding functionality for the controlls button. 

22.01

Cleaned up my code a bit, putting variables and functions to other functions
Began drawing the map for the 3rd level
Adding the finish game screen with a restart button

23.01

Implementing the 3rd level and adding Level Obstacles. Drawing objects, like a metal plate for an air vent
